<h3>Careers:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The College of Engineering is committed to provide students with internship opportunities as well as career options upon graduation. Here are a few resources for both students and recruiters to help great future engineers meet wonderful firms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Miami is known nationally and internationally as a highly selective, diverse source of bright and talented students, taught by a distinguished faculty involved in today's cutting edge research. The College of Engineering is proud to be a preferred recruiting partner for many of the world's leading firms, including GE, IBM, Allstate, FPL, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Cordis, UPS, and many others.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ViAComp:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ViAComp - Virtual Academic Computing - is a cloud computing platform for the students of the College of Engineering (CoE). ViAComp provides free remote access to educational software programs anytime and anywhere with an Internet connection. ViAComp also works on mobile platforms like an iPhone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ViAComp was introduced before the the term "cloud computing" was coined. This Virtual Academic Computing platform was developed for the benefit of students, who needed access to software in their research and academic projects. ViAComp contains over 50 software modules including Solid Works, Labview, ProEngineer, and Minitab</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Maker Space:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prototyping Facility with the latest in computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, capable of 5-axis milling and turning. The University of Miami College Of Engineering is pleased to announce the establishment of a professionally staffed, state-of-the-art Prototyping Facility, available for use both within UM and with outside customers. The 3000 square feet, air-conditioned facility is equipped to handle the most complex prototyping task (large or small).</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Research Opportunities for Students:</h3>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">NSF-REUs (National Science Foundations, Research Experiences for Undergraduates). There are 2 types of NSF-REUs and they are typically paid positions. One type is associated with single research grants that are awarded to the University through an individual Professor’s efforts. The other type are “site” REUs which are awards made to a particular University to host a larger group of students for work on several different research projects. The “site” REUs typically take place during the summer and usually require that the undergraduate student travel to the University hosting the site. The “site” REUs typically provide stipends that help offset the cost of housing. Announcements for “site” NSF-REUs are typically released between the December and February preceding the corresponding summer. Additional details about site REUs is available in the <a href="https://umshare.miami.edu/web/wda/engineeringfiles/CAE/solo/REU.pptx">Powerpoint presentation</a> and <a href="https://umshare.miami.edu/web/wda/engineeringfiles/CAE/solo/REU.pdf">fact sheet</a>.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">NSF-GRFP (NSF – Graduate Research Fellowship Program). These awards fund graduate school, including MS and PhD degrees. These awards are highly prestigious and are awarded to the student and can “follow” the student depending upon where they go to graduate school. To be competitive, students are highly recommended to work with a faculty member in developing their application. Deadlines for applications is typically sometime in November. More details are available at: the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">NSF web site</a>. The announcement for the competition is available at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program site</a></li>
